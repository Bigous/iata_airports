# IATA airports dataset generator

This is a simple jupyter script to get the data from [OurAirports](https://davidmegginson.github.io/ourairports-data/airports.csv) filter the airports with iata code, add the timezone column and save it so other systems can use a much smaller and usefull subset of OurAirports dataset with the timezone info.
